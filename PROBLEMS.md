### Instagram Rate Limit!
problem : Instagram graphql api has a rate limit ( 60 request per user per hour for now )

solution: my temporary solution is "one for all, all for one" :))

i want to make a list of instagram accounts and send general requests. 
for example if a user wants to get follower by "funny" hashtag and another user wants to get follower by "gym" hashtag, these two hashtag fetched by my account list and after collecting all target users, real accounts just send request to them.
